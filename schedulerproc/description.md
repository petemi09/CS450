# CPU scheduling

Implement the following CPU scheduling algorithms:

1. FCFS
1. SJF
1. Priority
1. Round-Robin

Assume all processes arrive to the queue simultaneously, so the process arrival time can be ignored. There is no preemption when using SJF or Priority scheduling (e.i. once the process is running, it cannot be preempted until its burst is over).

Pass the provided tests.

You are free to extend the provided classes, add new methods and data members.

I recommend using NetBeans as your IDE.
